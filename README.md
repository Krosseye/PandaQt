# PandaQt

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Panda3D game engine into a PySide6/Qt application. It provides an example of embedding a Panda3D rendering context into a standard `QWidget`, allowing it to be used within any Qt window.

While Panda3D supports hardware-accelerated rendering, `QWidget` does not. This example captures frames from Panda3D and displays them in a `QWidget`. Future updates may explore a `QOpenGLWidget`-based implementation to enhance performance.
